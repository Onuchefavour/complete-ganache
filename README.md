# Complete Ganache: Wellness Tracking Platform

A decentralized blockchain wellness platform that enables users to track health metrics, set personalized goals, and earn achievements while ensuring data privacy and individual sovereignty.

## Overview

Complete Ganache Wellness Platform is a blockchain-based wellness monitoring system that helps users track three key health metrics:
- Sleep quality
- Hydration levels
- Mindfulness practices

The platform features:
- Personal goal setting
- Daily activity logging
- Achievement badges
- Wellness scoring
- Privacy-focused data management
- Continuous streak tracking

## Architecture

The GlowNest system is built around a core smart contract that manages user data, goals, and achievements.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|Records Daily Metrics| B[GlowNest Tracker Contract]
    B --> C[User Profile]
    B --> D[Daily Metrics]
    B --> E[Personal Goals]
    B --> F[Achievements]
    B -->|Calculates| G[Wellness Score]
    B -->|Tracks| H[Activity Streaks]
```

The contract implements several key data structures:
- `users`: Stores user profiles and wellness scores
- `daily-metrics`: Records daily health activities
- `user-goals`: Maintains personal wellness targets
- `user-achievements`: Tracks earned achievements
- `achievement-definitions`: Defines available badges and requirements

## Contract Documentation

### Core Functionality

#### User Management
- User profiles are automatically created on first interaction
- Tracks join date, wellness score, and activity streaks
- Privacy-preserving design with principal-based identification

#### Metrics Tracking
- Records daily sleep hours (0-24)
- Monitors water intake in milliliters (0-10000)
- Tracks meditation minutes (0-1440)
- Prevents overwriting of same-day entries

#### Achievement System
Three categories of achievements:
1. Streak-based (7, 30, 100 days)
2. Wellness score milestones (50, 75, 90 points)
3. Goal completion tracking

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- All data is associated with user principals
- No direct access to other users' data
- Immutable history of wellness records

### Limitations
- Daily metrics can only be recorded once per day
- Metric values have reasonable upper limits
- Achievement badges cannot be revoked once earned

### Best Practices
- Always validate metric values before submission
- Regular backups of achievement records
- Monitor wellness score calculations for accuracy
